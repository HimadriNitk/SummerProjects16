01[20:40] <nat96> Hey guys! today's session is going to be pretty short. We'll be giving you some links you could go through.
01[20:41] <nat96> Also the reversing problems for you guys to solve will be put up by tonight
01[20:43] <nat96> Ok so I think we'll start today's session
01[20:44] <nat96> last time we saw some ciphers mainly substitution ciphers where each character in your msg was substituted by some other character using different schemes
01[20:45] <nat96> we talked about one time pads, frequency analysis, shift ciphers
01[20:45] <nat96> hope you guys are fine with all of that
[20:45] <sripathi> yes
[20:45] <Rohan_> yes
[20:46] <dhir> yes
01[20:46] <nat96> one thing i forgot to mention was, simple ciphers like shift cipher are monoalphabetic ciphers
02[20:46] * swathi_s (~androirc@116.202.25.74) Quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
01[20:46] <nat96> that means every character has a unique mapping throughout the msg
01[20:47] <nat96> but ciphers like the one time pad are polyalphabetic ciphers
01[20:47] <nat96> monoalpha ciphers are susceptible to attacks using frequency analysis like we already saw
01[20:48] <nat96> now there are some more polyalpha ciphers which we'll see today
03[20:48] * yuvaraj (~yuvaraj@49.249.53.179) has joined #ieee-ctf
01[20:48] <nat96> one such cipher is the playfair cipher
01[20:49] <nat96> now its difficut to explain this without an example. i'm posting a link here, go through it and see if you understand. it's pretty simple
01[20:49] <nat96> http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/traditional_ciphers.htm
01[20:49] <nat96> i want all of you to look at this right now
01[20:51] <nat96> once you are done with this , also see vignere cipher
01[20:51] <nat96> its just after playfair
01[20:53] <nat96> oh and on a side note: there is this book called "the codebreakers" by david kahn. Anyone interested could check it out :)
01[20:55] <nat96> done? or still reading?:P
[20:56] <sripathi> still reading
01[20:57] <nat96> wokay, let me know when done
01[21:01] <nat96> you guys can continue reading it later and probably try it out to understand better
01[21:02] <nat96> ok so i'll continue, I'll take like 5 more mins and you guys can continue with your reading
01[21:02] <nat96> cool?
03[21:02] * Samvid (~Samvid@94.59.21.211) has joined #ieee-ctf
[21:03] <sripathi> yes
[21:03] <Samvid> Sorry for being late and interrupting...how much did I miss?
01[21:04] <nat96> nothing much
01[21:04] <nat96>  i have posted a link, check the logs later
01[21:04] <nat96> everyone is reading that now, you can read it later
01[21:05] <nat96> others are you with us here?
[21:05] <Rohan_> yep
[21:05] <Arunraj> yes
[21:06] <sripathi> yes
[21:06] <Suraj> yeah
[21:06] <Rohan_> out of curiosity...what was the encryption alan turing was trying to decode during the world war?
01[21:10] <nat96> i'm not aware of that :P
01[21:10] <nat96> you could google it
01[21:11] <nat96> ok so we have seen substitution ciphers, now there is something called Transposition Cipher
[21:11] <sripathi> its a polyalphabetic substitution cipher
[21:11] <sripathi> for the enigma machine
01[21:12] <nat96> here you change the order in which the characters appear in the plaintext. so its basically rearrangement
01[21:12] <nat96> thanks @sripathi
01[21:13] <nat96> the easiest way is to write everything backwards
03[21:13] * Arun97 (~Arunraj97@117.192.62.139) has joined #ieee-ctf
[21:13] <sripathi> so longer the message..harder to disassemble
[21:14] <sripathi> decrypt i mean
01[21:14] <nat96> just go ahead with the link, there are examples of transposition ciphers
01[21:14] <nat96> yeah correct @sripathi
01[21:15] <nat96> there are many other ciphers, you guys can explore them
01[21:15] <nat96> so like i said earlier, its gonna be a really short session :P
02[21:15] * Arunraj (~Arunraj97@117.192.62.139) Quit (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
01[21:16] <nat96> these ciphers are really easy to understand, so don't worry about it much
01[21:16] <nat96> now we want you guys to start trying out crypto challenges on cryptopal. its this website where you get ctf like challenges.
01[21:17] <nat96> https://cryptopals.com/
01[21:17] <nat96> try matasano challenges, they will be difficult, but its worth giving it a try
01[21:17] <nat96> it'll help you guys get accustomed to some crypto challenges
01[21:18] <nat96> also reversing problems will be posted by tonight, do try them out
01[21:18] <nat96> so things to do: 
01[21:19] <nat96> see the links i gave you
01[21:19] <nat96> try the crypto problems, may be difficult, don't get all worked up.its fine,its just for practice :P
01[21:19] <nat96> do reversing problems
01[21:20] <nat96> ok so thats it for today. you can contact one of us if you have any doubts, we'll try our best to solve them
01[21:20] <nat96> goodnight! see you guys at the next session!
