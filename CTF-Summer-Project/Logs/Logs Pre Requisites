           ⤷ │ Create a new repo IEEE CTF Summer project 2016
      Sreeps │ do we have to download git onto our desktops?
  @chinmay_d │ Sreeps: Are you on Windows?
      Sreeps │ as of now..no
  @chinmay_d │ Cool, try running "git --version"
           ⤷ │ If it does not show you the version number, install it using "sudo apt-get install git" :)
           ⤷ │ *Assuming apt-get is your package manager*
           ⤷ │ Do you all have git setup?
      Samvid │ yup
  @chinmay_d │ https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup
       Tarun │ yes
  rahul_kumm │ yes
  RohanSurve │ sorry for joining late
           ⤷ │ did i miss anything
           ⤷ │ ?
  @chinmay_d │ RohanSurve: not much.
           ⤷ │ If you have Git setup, you are fine.

      Sreeps │ yes
  RohanSurve │ yes
      Arun97 │ yup
       Tarun │ yes
     nandini │ yes
  @chinmay_d │ Nice. So as Prabhanjan mentioned, can you create an empty repository on Github and try pushing it from local computer?
           ⤷ │ It is important that you understand what version control is -> https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control
  @chinmay_d │ Git is a software and Github is a service provider used to "host" your Git projects.
           ⤷ │ We also have Gitlab, Bitbucket and other service providers.,
           ⤷ │ Similarly, we also have hg(mercury), bazaar and other version control systems
           ⤷ │ But the Git + Github combination is most popular.
           ⤷ │ While you are pushing your code to Github, if there are any doubts, please go ahead and ask.
      Sreeps │ when pushing the repo u have to type git remote add origin https://github.com/Sreeps/IEEE-CTF-Summer-Project-2016.git this right?
  @chinmay_d │ Sreeps: yes
       Tarun │ after that line do we have to type "git push -u origin master" ?
  @chinmay_d │ Did you make any changes to the empty repo?
       Tarun │ no
      Sreeps │ i didnt..but i am getting this error fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
    skarthik │ cd
  @chinmay_d │ Okay, so let me point out what to do exactly. Dont type until I am done.
  rahul_kumm │ same here
  @chinmay_d │ 1. Create a repo on Github
  rahul_kumm │ okay
  @chinmay_d │ 2. Clone the repo using "git clone <repo url>"
           ⤷ │ 3. "cd" into the repo
           ⤷ │ 4. Make a file named "hello.txt" and write content "hello, world" in the file.
           ⤷ │ 5. Do "git add hello.txt"
           ⤷ │ 6. "git commit -m 'Creates hello'"
           ⤷ │ 7. "git push origin master"
           ⤷ │ Everyone tried this?
       Tarun │ whats the third step?
  @chinmay_d │ You enter the repository you cloned :)
           ⤷ │ Was everyone able to see their new file on Github?
      Sreeps │ how do u cd into ur repo..do u type the repo url again?
      Samvid │ yup
  @chinmay_d │ "cd <folder name>"
       Tarun │ it says no such directory
  @chinmay_d │ Umm, the directory name will be the name of your project on Github
           ⤷ │ So if the project name is "Chinmay", type "cd Chinmay"
           ⤷ │ cd stands for "change directory (to)"
       Tarun │ cd Tarun-Karthik
           ⤷ │ sorry
  @chinmay_d │ Sure, no problems :)
       Tarun │ its giving me this $ cd -IEEE-CTF_Summer-project-2016
           ⤷ │ bash: cd: -I: invalid option
           ⤷ │ cd: usage: cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
  @chinmay_d │ Remove the "-" before "IEEE"
       Tarun │ now it says no such directory
  @chinmay_d │ Can you output the result of the "ls" command for me
           ⤷ │ Tarun: ^
  Prabhanjan │ I assume all of you have created the repo, and pushed some example file to the repo.
      Sreeps │ what is the difference between git add and git commit?
     ranjith │ sorry i'm late
       Tarun │ i was able to do the third step
  @chinmay_d │ Nice!
       Tarun │ where do we create and store the text file?
  @chinmay_d │ In the folder
      Sreeps │ in the repo folder?
  @chinmay_d │ Yep
  RohanSurve │ i am not able to clone the repo :/
      Arun97 │ same here
  RohanSurve │ it says no such file or directory
      Arun97 │ fatal: could not create work tree dir 'IEEE-CTF-Summer-project-2016': Permission denied
      Sreeps │ i am done
           ⤷ │ u must first create the repo in github
      Arun97 │ ya i did that
  RohanSurve │ did that
       Tarun │ i am done too
      Sreeps │ u need u to type the full url
           ⤷ │ after git clone
  Prabhanjan │ Yeah create the repo
           ⤷ │ Then clone it locally using git clone <URL of the repo>
  RohanSurve │ syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
           ⤷ │ i am getting this erroe!
  Prabhanjan │ For example - git clone https://github.com/PrabhanjanPM/IEEE-CTF.git
  RohanSurve │ \msg sreeps
  Prabhanjan │ How many are yet to push anything to the repo ?
      Sreeps │ its forward slash Rohan
  RohanSurve │ i am
     nandini │ while pushing the file into the repo it is giving an error   fatal: pathspec 'hello.txt' did not match any files
  Prabhanjan │ Whoever is done, I need you to write a python program to create an array(or list or dictionary depending on your choice) of the names in this group
           ⤷ │ and sort them
           ⤷ │ according to alphabetical order
