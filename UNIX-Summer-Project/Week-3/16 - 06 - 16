:AdithyaBhat :Hello everyone.
:AdithyaBhat :Today we will be learning about tool developments, so that you can start working on your projects.

:rahul_kummi!~Rahul@117.231.255.107 JOIN #ieee-UNIX

:AdithyaBhat :For demonstration purposes I'll be showing you how to install a software called axel.
:AdithyaBhat :Before we begin, is everyone clear with the PATH variable concept?

:kaushik_sk :yeah
:AdithyaBhat :I won't proceed without an answer. :/
:Harita_Reddy :yes

:swati_ :yes
:AdithyaBhat :Any program that you install, their binaries will be put in the /usr/bin folder.
:siddhanth :ok
:Adithybhat :Eg. whereis ls
:Adithybhat :You can try it out.
:Adithybhat :To write your own command would now simply mean to make sure your C program or any script is in any of the PATH defined folders.
:Adithybhat :Clear?
:swati_ :yes
:kaushik_sk :yeah
:Adithybhat :So for your project you will be writing programs, for which you will have to write scripts to INSTALL them as well.
:Adithybhat :INSTALL means to copy the script/binary to one of the folders and create symbolic links in the other folders.
:Adithybhat :Symbolic links ensure that if one of the folders are accidentally corrupted or deleted, you can still access them.

:Adithybhat :It is however optional to create these sym links.
:Adithybhat :https://github.com/angelj-a/axel
:Adithybhat :The above link contains the source code for a software called axel.
:Adithybhat :It is a command line download manager.
:Adithybhat :A very powerful one for that matter.
:Adithybhat :There are two ways to install this software.
:Adithybhat :You can install it from the Ubuntu Repositories(Repos).
:Adithybhat :By typing `sudo apt-get install axel'
:Adithybhat :However this will not guarantee that the software is the latest one.
:Adithybhat :There are lots of outdated softwares in ubuntu repos.
:Adithybhat :The second way is to BUILD from source.
:Adithybhat :Meaning compile from the source code.
:Adithybhat :Go to the above link and download the zip source for now.
:Adithybhat :Tell me when you are done.
:siddhanth :done
:kaushik_sk :done
:Harita_Reddy :done
:swati_ :done
:Adithybhat :Now unzip it.
:Adithybhat :Open a terminal in that folder.
:Adithybhat :Most of them will contain instructions on how to install the software.
:Adithybhat :In this case Readme.md contains those instructions.
:Adithybhat :Run ./configure
:Adithybhat :Then run make
:Adithybhat :Let me know when you are done.
:siddhanth :done
:Harita_Reddy :done
:Adithybhat :You should see an executable file "axel" in that folder.
:Adithybhat :No errors, i hope.

:kaushik_sk :done
:Adithybhat!dfe3ad89@gateway/web/freenode/ip.223.227.173.137 NICK :AdithyaBhat
:AdithyaBhat :Now you have the software compiled and ready.
:AdithyaBhat :You can run the software using ./axel
:AdithyaBhat :You can check it out by downloading something.
:AdithyaBhat :./axel -an 32 http://cl.releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso
:AdithyaBhat :If you have broadband it will give you very fast download speeds.
:AdithyaBhat :However, at the cost of the other users on the network.
:AdithyaBhat :you can install this software on your machine by running `sudo make install'
:AdithyaBhat :But one drawback of this method of installation is that everytime the source is updated you have to rebuild your software.
:AdithyaBhat :Manually.
:AdithyaBhat :This can be a pain if you have a lot of manually compiled softwares.
:AdithyaBhat :Clear?
:kaushik_sk :yeah
:kaushik_sk :so what's the alternative ?
:kaushik_sk :I mean. is there any ?
:AdithyaBhat :You only have two options.
:kaushik_sk :that allows automatic rebuild?
:AdithyaBhat :However the BUILD systems are designed intelligently.
:AdithyaBhat :When you run make on the updated code, only those components are compiled which have changed since the last version.
:AdithyaBhat :Resulting in saving a lot of computer time.
:AdithyaBhat :Also, patches are available which updates your software.
:AdithyaBhat :Or you can use up to date software repositories like packman.
:AdithyaBhat :*pacman - package manager
:AdithyaBhat :You can now easily write your own commands.
:AdithyaBhat :And this is what it means by Open Source. The source code being open and available for you to edit.
:AdithyaBhat :Some of them also provide libraries which can be used in other programs.
:AdithyaBhat :Any questions?
:AdithyaBhat :If you don't have any questions, I want you all to come up with your project ideas and/or teams.

:gautham_!3b58c5a2@gateway/web/freenode/ip.59.88.197.162 QUIT :Ping timeout: 250 seconds

:AdithyaBhat :You have time till Sunday 9PM to come up with your project details.
:AdithyaBhat :The session is over for today.
:kaushik_sk :A help tool. It might seem redundant. But something that simplifies whatever is in man.

:gautham_!3b63c45b@gateway/web/freenode/ip.59.99.196.91 JOIN #ieee-UNIX

:AdithyaBhat :You will write code to simplify man?
:AdithyaBhat :Or to display simpler help pages?
:kaushik_sk :If it is possible.
:kaushik_sk :return docstrings of specific options
:kaushik_sk :with some work, return related pages too. web links etc
:kaushik_sk :help grep -e 
:kaushik_sk :should return what that option does
:AdithyaBhat :You can check out doxygen and info.
:AdithyaBhat :Redundancy doesn't matter for now.
:AdithyaBhat :We will look for ingenious and high quality applications.
:AdithyaBhat :Not something that can be coded in two days and forgotten later.
:AdithyaBhat :Something that has been well though of.
:AdithyaBhat :And well structured.

:gautham_!3b63c45b@gateway/web/freenode/ip.59.99.196.91 QUIT :Ping timeout: 250 seconds

:kaushik_sk :can you provided us with some example projects. Just so we know in what direction to think ?
:kaushik_sk :provide*
:siddhanth :yeah can you give us some demo projects
:AdithyaBhat :As an example: A very neatly designed junk file cleaner.
:AdithyaBhat :That scans folders and removes any swap or temporary files.
:AdithyaBhat :The user must be able to define and redefine junk files.
:AdithyaBhat :Or say, a command that will find and remove invalid soft links.
:AdithyaBhat :The above already exists.
:AdithyaBhat :for a folder.
:AdithyaBhat :You can write a command that cleans the whole system.
:AdithyaBhat :Another example would be a web scraping project.
:AdithyaBhat :Given a web page, say download all the .mp3 files in the page.
:AdithyaBhat :I hope you get the idea.
:siddhanth :yes
