AdithyaBhat:No worries, if you didn't btw.
AdithyaBhat:I'm not continueing until I get some response.
AdithyaBhat:*continuing
kaushik_sk:I've done.
AdithyaBhat:Today we also be learning about passwd and exit commands.
AdithyaBhat:A little bit of introduction to scripting in linux.
AdithyaBhat:And ofc sed.
kaushiksk!~kaushik21@117.215.132.19 QUIT :Quit: Leaving
AdithyaBhat:What do you think the command passwd does?
kaushik_sk:set a password ?
Harita_Reddy_:change password
swati:set or change password?
AdithyaBhat:yes.
AdithyaBhat:try it out.
AdithyaBhat:notice that you can only change the password of your own account.
AdithyaBhat:However the root user can change anyone's password.
AdithyaBhat:Does everyone know who a root is?
kaushik_sk:having access to files of all users ?
m_gautham:permission to do anything??
Harita_Reddy_:sort of admin or superuser?
bharath:is the main user who can access to all accounts??
AdithyaBhat:The root is like ADMINISTRATOR in Windows.
AdithyaBhat:They are the superuser.
AdithyaBhat:can override any restrictions.
AdithyaBhat:You might have used many commands starting with sudo.
AdithyaBhat:In a multiuser environment sudo allows any user to temporarily take on the role of the superuser.
AdithyaBhat:Open a terminal and try these commands.
AdithyaBhat:id -u
AdithyaBhat:sudo id -u
AdithyaBhat:and tell me what happens.
m_gautham:1000 for first and 0 for second

AdithyaBhat:Now imagine you're writing a program that performs a system task.
AdithyaBhat:obviously a normal user cannot do this because he will get permission denied messages from the system.

AdithyaBhat:Now let us start with the introduction to scripting.
AdithyaBhat:create a file with exit as the content.

AdithyaBhat:what are the results?

AdithyaBhat:without the quotes.
kaushiksk:ok. output "5".
AdithyaBhat:Everyone got the same output??
swati:i got "0" as the output
AdithyaBhat:dont run any commands in between.
AdithyaBhat:try `bash <filename>; echo "$?"'

swati:yeah
AdithyaBhat:what does your file have?
swati:exit 5
AdithyaBhat:what are the commands?
swati:cat >f1
swati:bash f1; echo "$?"
AdithyaBhat:the same commands are giving me 5.
AdithyaBhat:in the same terminal.
bharath:mine showed 0
AdithyaBhat:do not try the commands in different terminals.
swati:okay got it
swati:5
AdithyaBhat:still 0?
AdithyaBhat:quick notes.
bharath:if the text is 'exit 6' then it shows 6
AdithyaBhat:yes
AdithyaBhat:first of all bash stands for Bourne Again SHell.
AdithyaBhat:A shell is an intermediate between the kernel and the User.
AdithyaBhat:In UNIX/Linux the GUI is also a shell.
AdithyaBhat:Shells can be changed and customized.
AdithyaBhat:And thus so can your GUI.
AdithyaBhat:the bash you run is a program.
kaushiksk:ok
AdithyaBhat:everything you run in the terminal is a program written in C/C++ or others.
AdithyaBhat:some programs are a part of the shell. As in, they are embedded into your shell like grapes in plum cake.
AdithyaBhat:you can find out if a command is a shell built in or external by using the type command.
AdithyaBhat:try `type echo'
AdithyaBhat:or `type type'
AdithyaBhat:or `type ls'

AdithyaBhat_:Need to speed up.
AdithyaBhat_:Still in intro.
AdithyaBhat_:so basically the commands are programmed in such a way that they return non zero values when they fail.

AdithyaBhat!dfe33dd9@gateway/web/freenode/ip.223.227.61.217 QUIT :

AdithyaBhat_:so if a task requires a few commands to work before doing something dangerous say delete a fail, they can use the exit status of the prerequisite commands.
AdithyaBhat_:Understood?
kaushiksk:ok
abhisheks:yup
gautham_:ok
gautham_:what happend??
AdithyaBhat_:now about echo
AdithyaBhat_:it just prints whatever is given in double quotes.
AdithyaBhat_:say you want to use escape characters like \n.
AdithyaBhat_:then you must use echo -e "\n"
kaushiksk:what does -e do 
AdithyaBhat_:enable interpretation of escape sequences.
AdithyaBhat_:now does everyone remember running ./a.out
AdithyaBhat_:?
kaushiksk:yup
Harita_Reddy_:yes
gautham_:i didnt get it
AdithyaBhat_:always remember if you give a file to the shell it will run it.
AdithyaBhat_:on two conditions.
AdithyaBhat_:it should know what to call to run the file.
AdithyaBhat_:and it should know where the source is.
AdithyaBhat_:moving on.
AdithyaBhat_:how many of you know python?
kaushiksk:me

kaushiksk:it says missing operand after '..'
AdithyaBhat:i meant `chmod u+x <your file>'
kaushiksk:ok done
AdithyaBhat:./<your file>
AdithyaBhat:should work now.
kaushiksk:does nothing
AdithyaBhat:you could write any number of commands on seperate lines
AdithyaBhat:to see results replace exit with a echo command.
AdithyaBhat:your file could be like this.
AdithyaBhat:#!/bin/bash
AdithyaBhat:echo "...."
AdithyaBhat:now run ./<your file>
kaushiksk:works 
kaushiksk:shows whatever is inside quotes in echo "..."
AdithyaBhat:for those of you who know python, you can write python programs in a file.
AdithyaBhat:add `#!/usr/bin/python' for python 2.x
AdithyaBhat:and `#!/usr/bin/python3'
AdithyaBhat:any doubts?

AdithyaBhat:Lets start with the first homework question.
kaushiksk:ok
AdithyaBhat:printing odd lines.
AdithyaBhat:of a file.

kaushiksk:1,$
AdithyaBhat_:you can use it like 1,2 or 2,3 or 1,100 or 3,$ and so on.
AdithyaBhat_:the ~ is the step operator.
AdithyaBhat_:meaning how much to increment to go the next address.
AdithyaBhat_:so 1~2 would mean 1,3,5,7, and so on.

kaushiksk:sed -n 's/regexp/&/p' filename

AdithyaBhat_:now how to make sed not print all the lines?
kaushiksk:-n
AdithyaBhat_:ie not print the stream.
AdithyaBhat_:good.
AdithyaBhat_:task 2. use search key word as pattern
AdithyaBhat_:how?
AdithyaBhat_:the command is:
AdithyaBhat_:sed -n '/pattern/p'
AdithyaBhat_:and grep "pattern"
AdithyaBhat_:both will give the same results.
AdithyaBhat_:try it.
kaushiksk:yup
AdithyaBhat_:moving on to the third task.
AdithyaBhat_:substitution.
AdithyaBhat_:the p command will print
AdithyaBhat_:and similarly d will delete the line from the stream or file.
AdithyaBhat_:d is also therefore, dangerous:P
AdithyaBhat_:sed can be used to substitute things in a stream.
AdithyaBhat_:the format is as follows.
AdithyaBhat_:sed 's/abc/dcx/'
AdithyaBhat_:you can add a command at the end.
AdithyaBhat_:like s/abc/def/p
AdithyaBhat_:like s/abc/def/d
AdithyaBhat_:like s/abc/def/g
AdithyaBhat_:g stands for global.
AdithyaBhat_:meaning replace all occurences in the line.
AdithyaBhat_:you can also write the substituted stream to another file with the w command
AdithyaBhat_:like s/abc/def/gw fname
AdithyaBhat_:& stands for the selected pattern
AdithyaBhat_:s/abc/& &/ will replace abc with "abc abc"
AdithyaBhat_:clear?
kaushiksk:yup
Harita_Reddy_:yes
AdithyaBhat_:good.
AdithyaBhat_:others?
gautham_:ok
kaushiksk:dont we enter input file like we do with grep ?
kaushiksk:then how do we mention file to write into as in "s/abc/def/gw fname"
AdithyaBhat_:like this.
AdithyaBhat_:sed 's/abc/def/gw output' input
kaushiksk:ah ok 
AdithyaBhat_:for more cool and advanced tricks refer to: http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html
