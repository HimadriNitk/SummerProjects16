[2016-05-20 19:59:36] <isha_97> Hello Everyone!  Today we will be discussing about transport layer and application layer.
[2016-05-20 20:00:19] <isha_97> So can anyone tell me the function of network layer ?
[2016-05-20 20:01:11] <Harita_Reddy> Divides data into packets
[2016-05-20 20:02:02] <isha_97> okay. what functionality does it serve for sending the packet ?
[2016-05-20 20:02:08] <Shantanu> and delivers them from the source to the destination
[2016-05-20 20:02:11] <Harita_Reddy> and ensures that the intended receiver receives the packets

[2016-05-20 20:02:56] <Harita_Reddy> decision of path for packet
[2016-05-20 20:03:03] <isha_97> yeah. So network layer oversees source-to-destination delivery of individual packets

[2016-05-20 20:03:46] <isha_97> But suppose you are sending a message from one computer to another using gmail and facebook.
[2016-05-20 20:04:02] <isha_97> does it ever happen that the message interchange ?
[2016-05-20 20:04:20] <Shantanu> nope

[2016-05-20 20:04:47] <isha_97> so this is taken care by transport layer.
[2016-05-20 20:05:12] <isha_97> It is responsible for process to process delivery.

[2016-05-20 20:07:08] <isha_97> Every process will use a different port number.
[2016-05-20 20:07:33] <isha_97> so now we define a socket as a combination of ip address and port number.
[2016-05-20 20:08:15] <isha_97> any doubts till here ?

[2016-05-20 20:08:40] <Shantanu> what's a socket?
[2016-05-20 20:08:54] <isha_97> socket is a buffer space which stores ip address and port number.
[2016-05-20 20:08:54] → revanth joined (~revanth@106.206.157.226)
[2016-05-20 20:09:33] <Harita_Reddy> and what exactly do you mean by process to process?
[2016-05-20 20:10:09] <isha_97> like in the example I gave gmail and facebook are two processes running in your computer.
[2016-05-20 20:10:28] <isha_97> so the message must reach to intended process.
[2016-05-20 20:11:08] <Harita_Reddy> okay
[2016-05-20 20:11:11] <isha_97> should we continue ?
[2016-05-20 20:11:23] <Shantanu> yeah

[2016-05-20 20:12:11] <isha_97> So in transport layer there are 3 protocols- UDP, TCp and SMTP.
[2016-05-20 20:12:35] <isha_97> protocols are the set of rules which are applied to the connection.
[2016-05-20 20:12:59] <isha_97> we will be discussing only about tcp and udp.
[2016-05-20 20:13:13] <isha_97> So I'll start with UDP.
[2016-05-20 20:13:29] <isha_97> It stands for User Datagram Protocol.
[2016-05-20 20:14:23] <isha_97> It sends data in the form of datagram.
[2016-05-20 20:15:01] <isha_97> This is the format of a datagram : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/d/d9/Header_of_UDP.jpg
[2016-05-20 20:16:04] <isha_97> we will discuss about checksum later.
[2016-05-20 20:16:34] <isha_97> so any doubt in the datagram format ?
[2016-05-20 20:16:59] <aswin_> no
[2016-05-20 20:17:06] <Aneesh_> no
[2016-05-20 20:17:36] <isha_97> okay so moving further, udp is a connectionless protocol.
[2016-05-20 20:18:14] <isha_97> It's doesn't establish a connection between sender and receiver before sending the packets.
[2016-05-20 20:18:25] <isha_97> It randomly sends packets.
[2016-05-20 20:18:46] <isha_97> without caring about reliability.
[2016-05-20 20:19:27] <isha_97> So there is a high chance of packet loss.
[2016-05-20 20:20:49] <isha_97> these are some of the well known udp ports: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc959828.aspx
[2016-05-20 20:21:17] <Shantanu> okay
[2016-05-20 20:21:35] <isha_97> now moving to tcp protocol.
[2016-05-20 20:21:55] <isha_97> It sends data in the form of stream.
[2016-05-20 20:22:39] <isha_97> It is connection oriented i.e. it establishes a connection between sender and receiver prior to sending data.
[2016-05-20 20:22:51] <isha_97> This is known as tcp handshake.
[2016-05-20 20:23:36] <isha_97> This is the format of a tcp packet : http://www.h3c.com.hk/res/200705/31/20070531_107806_image017_195599_57_0.jpg
[2016-05-20 20:24:22] <isha_97> It contain too many fields you need to worry about the details of each field. i'll send you link to read about it.
[2016-05-20 20:25:58] <isha_97> Now we will see how does tcp works ?
[2016-05-20 20:26:18] <isha_97> the first step will be connection establibshment.

[2016-05-20 20:27:23] <isha_97> so as you know the information is divided into packets, each packet will have a number known as sequence number.
[2016-05-20 20:27:48] <isha_97> the connection establishment is done by 3-way handshaking.
[2016-05-20 20:28:29] <isha_97> The client sends the first segment, a SYN segment, in which only the SYN flag is set. This segment is for synchronization of sequence numbers. It consumes one sequence number. When the data transfer starts, the sequence number is incremented by 1. We can say that the SYN segment carries no real data, but we can think of it as containing 1 imaginary byte.
[2016-05-20 20:29:38] <isha_97> Then , The server sends the second segment, a SYN + ACK segment, with 2 flag bits set: SYN and ACK. This segment has a dual purpose. It is a SYN segment for communication in the other direction and serves as the acknowledgment for the SYN segment. It consumes one sequence number.
[2016-05-20 20:30:27] <isha_97> Finally, the client sends the third segment. This is just an ACK segment. It acknowledges the receipt of the second segment with the ACK flag and acknowledgment number field. Note that the sequence number in this segment is the same as the one in the SYN segment; the ACK segment does not consume any sequence numbers.
[2016-05-20 20:30:54] <isha_97> you can see the SYN and ACK field in the packet format.
[2016-05-20 20:32:45] <isha_97> here segment= packet
[2016-05-20 20:33:21] <isha_97> are you guys following ?
[2016-05-20 20:35:10] <isha_97> ask me if u didn't understand 
[2016-05-20 20:36:04] <isha_97> shall we continue ?
[2016-05-20 20:36:18] <Harita_Reddy> can u explain SYN flag again?
[2016-05-20 20:36:50] <isha_97> refer to the packet formt. can you see a field SYN ?
[2016-05-20 20:36:57] <isha_97> *format
[2016-05-20 20:37:19] <isha_97> in the 4th row
[2016-05-20 20:37:34] <Harita_Reddy> yes
[2016-05-20 20:38:13] <isha_97> so initially on ly that field will be 1 and others will be zero.
[2016-05-20 20:38:58] <isha_97> so it'll indicate that you have sent a synchronization segment and a connection need to be established.
[2016-05-20 20:39:30] <Harita_Reddy> ok
[2016-05-20 20:39:50] <isha_97> so everyone following ?
[2016-05-20 20:40:04] <aswin_> yes
[2016-05-20 20:40:11] <Aneesh_> yeah
[2016-05-20 20:40:39] <isha_97> so what will be the next step after a connection is established ?
[2016-05-20 20:41:35] <isha_97> ??
[2016-05-20 20:41:48] <Shantanu> finding the right path to send data?
[2016-05-20 20:41:52] <Aneesh_> send data?
[2016-05-20 20:42:05] <isha_97> yeah. Data transfer.
[2016-05-20 20:42:20] <chinmay_dd> I am also following! :D
[2016-05-20 20:42:47] <isha_97> So there are different flow and error control techniques for data transfer in tcp.
[2016-05-20 20:43:04] <isha_97> good @chinmay_dd 
[2016-05-20 20:43:41] <isha_97> after the data is sent, the connection will be terminated.
[2016-05-20 20:44:26] <isha_97> connection termination is done in the same way as connection establishment ,instead of the SYN packet FIN packet is sent.
[2016-05-20 20:45:06] <isha_97> The client TCP, after receiving a close command from the client process, sends the first segment, a FIN segment in which the FIN flag is set. Note that a FIN segment can include the last chunk of data sent by the client, or it can be just a control segment.
[2016-05-20 20:45:37] <isha_97> he server TCP, after receiving the FIN segment, informs its process of the situation and sends the second segment, a FIN + ACK segment, to confirm the receipt of the FIN segment from the client and at the same time to announce the closing of the connection in the other direction.
[2016-05-20 20:46:28] <isha_97> The client TCP sends the last segment, an ACK segment, to confirm the receipt of the FIN segment from the TCP server. This segment contains the acknowledgment number, which is 1 plus the sequence number received in the FIN segment from the server.

[2016-05-20 20:50:48] <isha_97> was it discussed in data link layer ?
[2016-05-20 20:51:23] <Shantanu> no
[2016-05-20 20:51:32] <Shantanu> it wasn't as of what i remember
[2016-05-20 20:52:28] <isha_97> okay. So I won't be discussing the sliding window protocol used in tcp as it'll be difficult for you to understand.
[2016-05-20 20:52:31] <Harita_Reddy> go back N was just mentioned i think
[2016-05-20 20:52:54] <isha_97> you can watch this video later : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHaSQBOrYDI
[2016-05-20 20:53:01] <Shantanu> yeah go back n was discussed
[2016-05-20 20:53:42] <isha_97> Okay so as I told you that we will discuss about checksum.
[2016-05-20 20:54:22] <isha_97> when you send packets there are chances that the bits might get corrupted.
[2016-05-20 20:54:53] <isha_97> So you need a error detection mechanism.
[2016-05-20 20:55:07] <isha_97> checksum is a error detecting code.
[2016-05-20 20:56:35] <isha_97> divide your data packets into group of 16 bits. add them. take the complement. The final answer will be checksum.
[2016-05-20 20:57:20] <isha_97> suppose I divide the packet as P, Q, R then C  = (P+Q+R)'
[2016-05-20 20:57:42] <isha_97> So what will be the vlue of P+Q+R+C ?
[2016-05-20 20:57:59] <aswin_> zero
[2016-05-20 20:58:06] <Ravali> 0
[2016-05-20 20:58:09] <isha_97> correct

[2016-05-20 20:59:17] <isha_97> So you send checksum and at receiver you add the sum to checksum, if the final answer comes to be zero then there is no error in the packets.

[2016-05-20 20:59:47] <isha_97> So Checksum is one of the error control technique.
[2016-05-20 21:00:49] <isha_97> So any doubts till now ?
[2016-05-20 21:01:46] <isha_97> shall we continue ?
[2016-05-20 21:01:53] <Shantanu> yup
[2016-05-20 21:01:54] <aswin_> ok
[2016-05-20 21:02:19] <isha_97> Now we will move on to application layer.
[2016-05-20 21:02:43] <isha_97> The application layer is responsible for providing services to the user.
[2016-05-20 21:03:23] <isha_97> here are several applications in the application layer of the Internet model that follow the client/server paradigm. The client/server programs can be divided into two categories: those that can be directly used by the user, such as e-mail, and those that support other application programs. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a supporting program that is used by
[2016-05-20 21:03:23] <isha_97> other programs such as e-mail.

[2016-05-20 21:04:47] <isha_97> any idea about DNS ?
[2016-05-20 21:05:35] <Shantanu> kinda
[2016-05-20 21:05:47] <isha_97> speak up!
[2016-05-20 21:05:49] <Shantanu> heard of dns servers and stuff
[2016-05-20 21:05:58] <aswin_> converts domain name to ip
[2016-05-20 21:06:08] <isha_97> Do you know what is it for ?
[2016-05-20 21:07:00] <isha_97> yeah
[2016-05-20 21:07:40] <isha_97> so can you people remember the ip address of every website ? :P
[2016-05-20 21:07:54] <Shantanu> no
[2016-05-20 21:08:20] <isha_97> To identify an entity, TCPIIP protocols use the IP address, which uniquely identifies the connection of a host to the Internet. However, people prefer to use names instead of numeric addresses. Therefore, we need a system that can map a name to an address or an address to a name.
[2016-05-20 21:09:36] <isha_97> This is the visual representation of dns : http://images.slideplayer.com/23/6599132/slides/slide_5.jpg
[2016-05-20 21:10:17] <isha_97> It is a hierarchical name space, each name is made of several parts. The first part can define the nature of the organization, the second part can define the name of an organization, the third part can define departments in the organization, and so on.
[2016-05-20 21:11:14] <isha_97> giving a formal definition:
[2016-05-20 21:11:24] <isha_97> The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP
[2016-05-20 21:11:24] <isha_97> addresses needed for the purpose of locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. 
[2016-05-20 21:12:20] <isha_97> everyone following ?
[2016-05-20 21:13:17] <aswin_> yeah
[2016-05-20 21:14:09] <isha_97> so in the tree, can anyone tell me the full domain name of the node robot ?
[2016-05-20 21:15:02] <Aneesh_> yale.edu/cs/ai/robot ?
[2016-05-20 21:15:38] <isha_97> others ?
[2016-05-20 21:16:10] <isha_97> everyone awake? :P
[2016-05-20 21:16:26] <Shantanu> i am
[2016-05-20 21:16:41] <Shantanu> i think i would agree with Aneesh
[2016-05-20 21:16:53] <isha_97> okay. That's not correct
[2016-05-20 21:17:08] <gautham__> im awake
[2016-05-20 21:17:27] <isha_97> It will be robot.ai.cs.yale.edu
[2016-05-20 21:17:40] <Aneesh_> okay
[2016-05-20 21:17:51] <Shantanu> oh
[2016-05-20 21:17:55] <Shantanu> okay
[2016-05-20 21:18:07] <isha_97> what will be for the node jack ?
[2016-05-20 21:18:39] <Aneesh_> jack.acm.org
[2016-05-20 21:18:43] <Shantanu> jack.acm.org
[2016-05-20 21:18:55] <Shantanu> using the same logic
[2016-05-20 21:19:00] <isha_97> yeah!
[2016-05-20 21:19:37] <isha_97> So there are certain rules.
[2016-05-20 21:19:51] <isha_97> the node string is called "label"
[2016-05-20 21:20:24] <isha_97> The tree can have only 128 levels: level 0(root) to level 127
[2016-05-20 21:21:20] <isha_97> So as aswin_  said that dns converts comain name to ip. This mapping is done by a resolver.
[2016-05-20 21:22:23] <isha_97> DNS is designed as a client/server application. A host that needs to map an address to a name or a name to an address calls a DNS client called a resolver. The resolver accesses the closest DNS server with a mapping request. If the server has the information, it satisfies the resolver; otherwise, it either refers the resolver to other servers or asks other
[2016-05-20 21:22:23] <isha_97> servers to provide the information. So a resolver can map name to address or vice versa.
[2016-05-20 21:23:36] <isha_97> shall we continue ?
[2016-05-20 21:24:15] <Harita_Reddy> yes
[2016-05-20 21:24:17] <gautham__> yes
[2016-05-20 21:24:35] <aswin_> yes
[2016-05-20 21:24:39] <isha_97> now we will see dns messages
[2016-05-20 21:24:52] <isha_97> DNS has two types of messages: query and response.
[2016-05-20 21:25:57] <isha_97> Response msg format: http://netlab.ulusofona.pt/rc/book/2-application/2_05/02-22.jpg     Query msg : only header and question section.
[2016-05-20 21:26:20] <isha_97> the header is the 12byte section.
[2016-05-20 21:27:39] <isha_97> The identification subfield is used by the client to match the response with the query. The client uses a different identification number each time it sends a query. The server duplicates this number in the corresponding response. The flags subfield is a collection of subfields that define the type of the message, the type of answer requested, the type of
[2016-05-20 21:27:39] <isha_97> desired resolution (recursive or iterative), and so on. The number of question records subfield contains the number of queries in the question section of the message. The number of answer records subfield contains the number of answer records in the answer section
[2016-05-20 21:27:39] <isha_97> of the response message. Its value is zero in the query message. The number of authoritative records subfield contains the number of authoritative records in the authoritative section of a response message. Its value is zero in the query message. Finally, the number of additional records subfield contains the number additional records in the additional
[2016-05-20 21:27:39] <isha_97> section of a response message. Its value is zero in the query message.
[2016-05-20 21:29:57] <isha_97> any doubt ?

[2016-05-20 21:34:30] <Aneesh_> lol okay
[2016-05-20 21:35:00] <isha_97> Question Section: This is a section consisting of one or more question records. It is present on both query and response messages.A question record is used by the client to get information from a server. This contains the domain name.
[2016-05-20 21:35:35] <isha_97> Answer Section: This is a section consisting of one or more resource records. It is present only on response messages. This section includes the answer from the server to the client (resolver). Each domain name (each node on the tree) is associated with a record called the resource record. The server database consists of resource records. Resource records
[2016-05-20 21:35:35] <isha_97> are also what is returned by the server to the client.
[2016-05-20 21:36:36] <isha_97> Authoritative Section: This is a section consisting of one or more resource records. It is present only on response messages. This section gives infonnation (domain name) about one or more authoritative servers for the query.
[2016-05-20 21:37:06] <isha_97> Additional Information Section: This is a section consisting of one or more resource records. It is present only on response messages. This section provides additional infonnation that may help the resolver. For example, a server may give the domain name of an authoritative server to the resolver in the authoritative section, and include the IP address of
[2016-05-20 21:37:06] <isha_97> the same authoritative server in the additional information section.
