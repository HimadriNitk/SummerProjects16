1) What is the importance of error detection and correction, and the difference between them?
2) Explain the 2 methods of error correction.
3) What is the central concept in error detection and correction, and how is it achieved?
4) Consider this table of datawords and their corresponding codewords.
	00 - 000
	01 - 011
	10 - 101
	11 - 110
	Apply block coding and analyze what happens if the dataword is 01 and the receiver receives 111,011 and 110 individually.
5) Consider a 2D-parity check code.
	0 0 1 1
	1 0 1 0
	1 1 1 1
	1 0 0 1
	1 1 1 1
	Here, the last row and column are filled such that, the no.of 1's in that particular row or column is even. Can this code be used to detect 2-bit, 3-bit and 4-bit errors? Explain individual cases in which each of these errors can be detected or not detected. 
6) Differentiate between byte stuffing and bit stuffing. 
7) What is the importance of network layer?
8) Distinguish between the following:
	a. Switch and Router
	b. Forwarding and Routing
9) Explain the format of routing table and how it helps in routing. 
10) Use Dijkstra's Algorithm and find the shortest distance between vertices S and T in the graph.
